They were great, really soft, doughy and chewy, much better than their shop-bought counterparts. The combination of textures is what makes a muffin so enjoyable; the slightly crispy outer layer that you get from cooking them on a griddle or frying pan contrasts beautifully with the soft doughy inside.

It's flavoured -and coloured- with annatto seeds; they have a distinctive, slightly sharp flavour and a deep red colour, as you can see from the photos. This is an uncompromising meal. When you eat, it rampages down your throat. When I first made it, 'twas was like nothing I had ever tasted before and it remains one of the most unique flavours I have ever encountered. It's not just the heat from the chilli, its the combination of that along with the vinegary tang and the distinctive flavour of annatto which makes it.

11,,Spaghetti Carbonara,"The best pasta dish on the planet, I reckon, could only be the glorious Carbonara. It exemplifies everything great about Italian cuisine – simple, quick and with an emphasis on quality ingredients. It can be deceptively tricky to perfect however; too much heat when adding the eggs can result in scrambling them instead of gently cooking them to get the desired silky smooth sauce. My favourite way to have this meal is to make the sauce fairly runny, so that a lovely gooey creamy sauce collects at the bottom of your bowl. Each forkfull can then be stirred through this sauce to get it well coated before shoving it in your mouth with gusto, licking your lips and greedily going for another mouthful. This should not be done with any attempt to look dignified – just enjoy it!",,2,-,,6,1,2,1,medium,Y,Y,Diet ID,,Cuisine ID,

Comprising almost entirely of classic Scottish produce; raspberries, porridge oats, honey and Scotch whiskey, they are flavours that compliment eachother perfectly. You can’t really go wrong here in terms of method and quantities, if you just throw all of it together in a bowl and mix, you couldn’t fail to end up with something delicious. Normally though, the cream is whipped to form soft-peaks to provide some body and texture. Also I have crushed some of the raspberries with honey to make a kind of sauce, and also cooked the oats with the honey to form crunchy clusters which give some bite when folded through the cream.",,4,,2,,1,4,8,easy,,,2,Vegetarian,2,Italian
14,,Crab Salad,"Of all the delicious things in the world to eat, crab is easily one of my favourites. It's got an intense flavour of the sea and it's succulent, sweet and juicy. In short, it's fantastic. Preparing crab involves a bit of work and is fairly time consuming... but it's a labour of love and something I'd urge everyone to try. Cooked in generously seasoned water, the beautiful white meat is excellent whilst still warm, eaten straight from the shell. It hardly needs anything more, although mix it with a little mayonnaise, herbs and lemon juice and you have the beginnings of a delicious salad. I've been wanting to write a crab recipe for a while now, but found it difficult to think of a really photogenic looking dish that wasn't just a rip-off from one of the restaurants I've worked in. The custard part of this dish is similar to a crab creme brulee that we did at Wedgwood, and it's really tasty. The sweet flavour of crab infuses really well in cream, and the fresh herbs added at the end finish it off beautifully.",,6,,5,,5,4,2,medium,,,3,Gluten Free,3,Indian
15,,Stars and Stripes Bagel,"I was introduced to the ""Stars and stripes"" bagel by my brother Rob, who had had one from the Bagel Factory. The filling comprises of bacon, cream cheese, tomatoes and guacamole. It occurred to him that it'd be pretty good with the addition of sweet chilli sauce, which he requested, and he was right! He made it at home for me a couple of of times and it was excellent. So this is my homage to Rob's improved stars and stripes, with a slight variation...instead of guacamole I just used slices of avocado and seasoned them nicely with sea salt, black pepper, olive oil and a little lime juice.",,2,,,6,1,8,2,easy,,,4,Dairy Free,4,British
16,,Roast Garlic Soup,"I have always been a huge fan of garlic. It’s an awesome ingredient that provides a remarkable amount of flavour given its size… it is small but strong! Obviously it’s more potent when raw, and when used for something like pesto or hummus, you need only a tiny bit. After cooking garlic, however, it loses most of it’s kick and becomes much more mellow. So, if you’re making a pasta sauce for example, you might want a decent amount - 3 or 4 cloves perhaps - to sweat with olive oil for the base of the sauce. Roasting garlic increases the mellowing effect even more, and gives it an amazing deep flavour. This is my favourite way to prepare garlic, and it’s perfect for making soup.",,4,,"3,5",1,4,4,5,easy,,,5,Nut Allergy,5,Chinese

18,,Cullen Skink,"A perfect combination of smoked haddock, potatoes, leeks and cream make up this classic Scottish soup. I have written already about my love for smoked haddock in my Arbroath Smokie post, and this soup is further evidence for why smoked haddock is basically awesome. Some recipes for Cullen Skink will instruct to keep a rustic broth-like consistency, with pieces of potato and haddock giving a nice chunky texture, but I prefer to make a super smooth soup, like a veloute, and then garnish the soup with diced potatoes, flaked smoked haddock and herbs. This gives a nice texture contrast, but also looks fantastic too.",,4,,3,,2,4,5,easy,,,,,7,Thai
19,,"Aubergine, Tomato, Parmesan","Melanzane alla Parmigiana is a classic Italian dish of fried aubergines, tomato and parmesan, a bit like a lasagne but with aubergines instead of pasta. And it is delicious! Superior to lasagne in my opinion, if I had to choose between the two, melanzane  would win hands down. It’s so hot today I have opened all the windows and there is a warm breeze blowing through the room. The weather puts me in the mood for a salad, and thinking about this dish gave me the idea of doing a salad version of it, with crispy aubergine slices, fresh tomatoes and shavings of parmesan. The thought of it has my mouth watering already..",,4,,"1,2,3,5",1,3,2,2,easy,,,,,8,American

21,,Roast Mushroom Soup,"I have long been an advocate of the humble button mushroom. It’s one of these ingredients that’s so commonplace, I reckon it’s not appreciated to its full potential. A staple in your greasy breakfast fry-up, or as a mediocre ‘cream of mushroom soup’, the button mushroom is actually so much better that you might realise. They are high in umami – the taste that makes things savory – and they have a lot of powerful flavour locked inside. One of their characteristics is that they have an extremely high water content, making the flavour rather bland until you have reduced the moisture. I’ve also found that when you fry them in a hot pan with a pinch of salt until they’re dark and caramelised, the flavour is amazingly intense and savory. This is what gave me the idea of doing a roast mushroom soup. It’d be better than the average mushroom soup as it would be a rich golden colour, instead of grey, and the resulting flavour would be all the more powerful.",,4,,"1,3",1,5,4,5,easy,,,Dish Type ID,,,
22,,Stuffed Saddle of Lamb,"Lamb chops were always a staple part of our diet when we were young, usually simply roasted and served with baked potatoes and veg from the garden; simple but delicious. The loin meat from the top half of the saddle - the best end - is some of nicest and most tender from the whole animal. Keep the chops attached and you have a rack of lamb, perfect to roast whole and carve into classic lamb cutlets. The bottom half of the saddle - the short saddle - does not have any rib bones and so you would normally just roast this as a piece of loin. What we do in the restaurant is a little more special however; we take the loin from the bone, leaving a flap of the belly fat attached, then make a stuffing from sauteed kidneys and spinach and roll the loin up inside the fat. The saddle is then tied with string and roasted. It’s a lovely way to cook the loin meat as it’s quite well protected from the surrounding fat.",,,,,,,,,,,,1,Main,,
23,,"Roast Pork Fillet, Grain Mustard Sauce","Pork fillets are easily obtainable and relatively inexpensive, but the best thing about them is they usually come with trimmings attached to them which must be removed before cooking; and with these trimmings you can make a quick and delicious homemade sauce with no pre-made stocks or artificial seasoning. Just simple fresh ingredients. This recipe is one of the easiest and most delicious things to do with a pork fillet, and personal favourite of mine. Grain mustard is a classic pairing for pork, and combined with creamy mashed potatoes and cabbage, it’s an absolute winner!",,,,,,,,,,,,2,Light/Starter,,
24,,Arbroath Smoky,"With a coastline as extensive and diverse as Scotland’s, it’s not surprising that seafood is so popular here. The process of salting and smoking fish was originally a method of preserving the fish to enable long storage. Although not necessary as a means of survival anymore, smoked fish - salmon and haddock in particular - is commonly enjoyed all over the country because it’s simply delicious! I recently had great pleasure in making Cullen Skink - the traditional Scottish soup made with smoked haddock - but since it has been so warm recently I wanted to do something a bit less hearty and filling. Some sort of salad seemed like the best thing to do, so I just warmed the fish gently in some milk, and flaked it over a simple salad of baby spinach, spring onions and courgette sliced thinly into ribbons. Topped finally with a poached egg, simple but delicious.",,,,,,,,,,,,3,Salad,,

27,,Pasta Puttanesca,"My good friend Lewis gave me a slow cooker for my birthday this year, its fantastic because it allows me to braise meat and stews for a long time without having to be in the house. When I am sweating it out in the kitchen at work for 16 hours a day I can have my dinner slowly cooking for when I get back. I make tomato sauce with the slow cooker; tinned tomatoes, onion, garlic, and tomato puree simmered gently for several hours until it is dark and reduced. I then puree and pass it through a fine sieve to make it extra smooth. What you get is an amazingly rich dark red sauce. This can be used for any number of things, but my current favourite is to make salty pungent puttanesca with it. Classic puttanesca sauce is accompanied by spaghetti; literally “whore’s style spaghetti”, it’s packed with in-your-face flavours. Traditionally made with tomatoes, garlic, black olives, anchovies and capers, it’s salty and more-ish. It’s a good dish to have in your repertoire; because it’s made almost entirely with store cupboard ingredients it can be rustled up with just a moment’s notice, although in my recipe the tomato sauce is simmered for eight hours to make it extra rich. This isn’t essential but will make your sauce taste amazing! I recommend making a big batch of sauce and freezing it. As there are so many big and bold flavours going on here, I have added a good handful of parsley and basil to bring some freshness to the dish and vital splash of green, making it particularly eye-catching. I’m pleased with the photograph too, I think it does justice to the dish.",,4,,,,,,,,,,6,Accompaniment,,
28,,Chocolate Mousse,"For the last six months at work I’ve been on desserts, getting to grips with the complexities of sugar, caramel, chocolate and eggs in all their different forms (not to mention all the fantastic fruit and berries in season just now!). Chocolate is a steadfast ingredient in any dessert menu and quite fascinating to work with. Recently I have just learned how to temper chocolate to give it an amazingly shiny, brittle finish. It’s not the easiest thing to achieve; a precise technique that’s really satisfying when it works properly! Another thing I’ve been getting my head around is chocolate mousse; a classic dessert which is subtly difficult to perfect. I remember making it when I was young; whipped cream folded into melted chocolate, always resulting in a smooth but rather dense and rich mousse. A perfect mousse should be really light and melts in the mouth; not what I have in my memories of childhood! The lightness comes from incorporating whipped cream and whipped egg whites into the melted chocolate, but the result depends of the temperature of the chocolate; too hot and the air will collapse from the mousse; too cold and the chocolate will sieze up and become grainy. This recipe works well, the secret here is to heat and whisk egg yolks with sugar and water (or coffee, as in this recipe) to create a silky light sabayon which the chocolate is then melted into. From there I add whipped cream, and lastly some soft whipped egg whites to make it extra light and aerated.",,,,,,,,,,,,7,Bakery,,
29,,Chicken and Coriander Broth,"I was clearing out my fridge a few weeks ago and came across a selection of root vegetables lurking there, waiting to be turned into something tasty. The first thing that came to my mind was soup, and since we were in the middle of winter I was thinking along the lines of a chunky, meaty broth. I decided on Chicken, which would provide my soup with both the chunky meat component and the stock. A bunch of fresh coriander which also happened to be in my fridge could be involved here in some way, I thought. I remembered a Madhur Jaffrey recipe for coriander chicken curry, involving large quantities of fresh coriander, resulting in a vibrant green curry sauce. It was fantastic, and so I reckoned it could work in my soup too. The earthiness of all those root vegetables would be balanced by the fresh zing of the coriander, perhaps. I prepared the chicken in my usual way; removed the breasts, then cut up the remaining carcass into small pieces and fried until nicely caramelised for the stock. This time I actually chopped up the wings and legs too and added them to the stock for extra flavour. Once the stock was almost ready, after an hour or so, I took some out to gently poach the breast meat in a separate pan. Once perfectly barely cooked, I allowed them to cool before carefully cutting them into dice. All the vegetables and chicken diced to the same size, making for an attractive looking bowl of broth.",,,,,,,,,,,,8,Dessert,,
30,,Custard Tart,"After my quiche, which turned out to be lovely after a few attempts, the next obvious thing to do cook in my nice 9 x 2 inch cake ring was something sweet. I’ve always loved custard in its various forms; crème brûlée, anglaise, crème caramel…and custard tarts. The custard tart was glorified by Marcus Wareing when he cooked it for the Queen’s 80th birthday on the Great British Menu, and his recipe is “as close to perfection as any custard tart can be”, to quote the man himself. So this is it, except mine is bigger, and I used a different pastry to make the case. It’s the same basic pâte Brisée that Thomas Keller uses in his quiche, with the addition of sugar. It gives a simple, but beautifully light crust. You need a decent oven with a fan in it to cook the pastry. If your oven isn’t hot enough when you blind bake the pastry it’ll not set into shape properly. The oven in my new flat is rubbish, it heats from the bottom by a gas flame and there’s no fan so it doesn’t cook evenly at all. By the time the sides of the pastry were cooked the bottom was burnt! My first attempt was a disaster so I resorted to calling a friend; “Hi Richard can I come over to yours and make a custard tart?” He burst out laughing at me – this was quite an unusual request apparently – but was more than happy for me to make use of his oven to make delicious treats! And the pastry turned out beautifully. Thanks Richard!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,,Chicken and Pancetta,"I made this for my dinner a few weeks ago, I didn’t intend for it to be photographed and put up here, but it looked so good that I had to take a few snaps of it. It’s a really nice way to prepare chicken, and pretty easy too. I like chicken legs because they have so much more flavour than the breast meat, and by removing the bones and sinew they become an effortless pleasure to eat! The great thing about this dish is when you slice the chicken leg you see the beautiful glistening cross-section of the muscle, outlined by the crispy pancetta. I served it with sautéed button mushrooms, courgettes and a white wine cream sauce, generously finished with chopped parsley and a handful of baby spinach gently wilted through the sauce at the end. I love cooking vegetables and sauce together like this, in a kind of ragout…I advise a generous heap to present your chicken on, and have it with a salad and some nice white wine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,,Leek and Roquefort Quiche,"I was recently given the Bouchon collection, a set of books by one of my idols; Thomas Keller of The French Laundry. Bouchon is the three Michelin starred chef’s bistro in Yountville, California that serves French classics like beef bourguignon, salt cod brandade, and quiche. There is a chapter on the quiche where Keller talks about the lost art of making great quiche; something which seems to have gone out of fashion, or forgotten about. A proper quiche will be two inches deep, filled to the very brim with a barely set, perfectly light custard. The shortcrust pastry should be rich and crisp, and specifically 4-5mm thick, so that it remains crisp and doesn’t become soggy after cooking. I had a couple of attempts at this quiche before getting a satisfactory result, and I was pleased with my third try. I actually bought a 9″ quiche ring especially for the task as none of the pastry rings in my house were quite the right size. One of the brilliant things about this recipe is the lightness of the custard; Keller blitzes the custard mix in a blender before pouring into the pastry shell, aerating the mix and resulting in a delicate light filling. This recipe is more or less the same as that found in Bouchon, but I’ve added spinach to the filling and converted the ingredients from pounds and ounces to kilograms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,,Hummus,"I have a wonderful book called Jerusalem by Yottam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi. Kind of an ode to their home city, it’s filled with stories and delicious recipes. I like middle eastern food because for me it strikes a perfect balance between the heavily spiced dishes of the subcontinent further east, and the simpler, more fresh cuisine found in the mediterranean to the west. Jerusalem is an ancient city with a turbulent history; having been besieged, conquered and captured countless times. As a result it’s a city of many varying cultures, religions and traditions, and the food of Jerusalem reflects this diversity. Hummus is a big thing in the middle east, especially in Jerusalem, and unsurprisingly there is an endless debate from opposing cultures about how it should be prepared; warm or cold… smooth and creamy or rustic and chunky. And which spices or garnishes to accompany it, if any at all. Most of the hummus I have had from the shops here in the UK have been almost smooth with a slight grainy texture to them. This recipe from Ottolenghi is really smooth and creamy, and much lighter in colour than hummus I’ve had before. It’s opened my eyes to how great hummus can be… I definitely recommend you try it! I made it into a light lunch by simply garnishing it with a pile of chopped coriander, tomatoes, pine nuts and olive oil. I devoured it with some fresh toasted pitta bread. Fantastic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,,Mum's Tomato Soup,"This soup is extremely popular in our household, and one of the first recipes I learned off by heart. Probably closer to minestrone than tomato, It’s thick and hearty, guaranteed to fill you up. Instead of pasta, as in a typical minestrone, this soup has a handful of rice thrown in the beginning which swells up to thicken the liquid and give it some body. You could use lentils instead, if you prefer. This is a chunky, broth-like soup rather than being smooth and silky, and although I like to cut all the vegetables to a nice uniform shape and size, you can cut them any old way and be as rustic as you like. As with many soups, the quality of this one comes down to the stock. I will usually make this soup after cooking a joint of smoked gammon or bacon, using the delicious salty liquid as the meaty backbone for my tomatoey broth. I highly advise this, if not then some nice vegetable stock is an acceptable alternative. This soup is best enjoyed with freshly baked bread and butter. As for us, we were treated to Dad’s crusty baguettes, still piping hot from the oven",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,,Confit Guineafowl with Lentils,"My confit guinea fowl legs had been sitting happily in the fridge since last week and were just waiting to be turned into something tasty. After the success of the root veg that I served with the breast, I decided to go with something similar…with the addition of lentils. We serve puy lentils like this at work, served with hake which is pan fried with a nice crisp skin. It’s a really versatile garnish though, and works well with chicken, confit duck also. Although the flavour of the confit legs will be best if you leave them to mature in the fat for a week or more, you can do them just a day ahead and still get delicious results. I love lentils prepared like this. The addition of diced vegetables and bacon brings a freshness to the heavy lentils and elevates this dusty store-cupboard ingredient to new heights. And finishing it with freshly chopped garlic and a little white wine vinegar gives a much needed kick. A drizzle of olive oil around, and some crunchy sea salt on the crispy confit skin gives the final touch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,,Pork and Apple Sauce,"It’s apple season once again, and I was lucky to receive a huge box of bramley apples from the garden back home. There are three or four apple trees that surround the house; at this time of year the ground is awash with hundreds of them that have fallen in the wind. I peeled and chopped about thirty of them, tossed in a little lemon juice stewed them with several heaped spoonfuls sugar to make a smooth compote. It’s got delicious tang like only a bramley can give. I’m planning to make a few deep dish apple pies with the compote combined with some chunks of a sweet eating variety mixed through, but before I get round to it I wanted to make another classic dish and one of my all time favourites: roast pork and apple sauce. Bramley apples are perfect to accompany pork belly; the distinctive tang cuts through the rich fattiness of the meat and really makes the dish. I didn’t serve mine with any potatoes, just a generous heap of shredded sauteed cabbage. It was delicious. This method of cooking pork belly is one of the simplest I know of, and easily my favourite. The slow cooking process and the pressing of the belly afterwards makes for the best crunchy crackling you could imagine, and properly melt-in-the-mouth succulent meat. It’s really hard to beat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,,Chicken Confit with Lemon Dressing,"Confit is one of my favourite ways of cooking meat; with something like a duck leg the meat will be amazingly tender and succulent, and the crisp crunchy skin giving a lovely texture contrast. It’s hard not to adore this! Chicken confit is not often heard of, but its great. Elevating the humble chicken leg to new heights. Lemon chicken was something my mum often made when we were young. Simply place some chicken legs in a roasting tray with olive oil, lemons and seasoning and roast in a hot oven until golden and crisp. You get a load of amazingly tasty juices in the tray which are spooned over potatoes or mopped up with crusty bread. One of my favourite ever meals! So this is a new version of that dish; the confit chicken has a superior texture, and the lemon and olive oil dressing is enriched with the jus from the confit and loaded with chopped fresh herbs. For this one, I served it with some sauteed pak choi and buttered new potatoes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,,Barley Risotto with Chicken,"Years ago my friend Cecily showed me how to make risotto, she was so enthusiastic about the merits of this dish and was amazed that I’d never made it before! It was the start of a beautiful relationship; now a staple in my repertoire, I must have made hundreds of risottos, including a few variations…barley is a nice alternative to rice and perfect to serve with chicken I reckon. We feed barley to the hens on the farm, so this seems like an apt combination for a dish. A benefit of using barley instead of rice is that it’s considerably more difficult to overcook. Also the grains give a lovely bursting sensation when you chew them which is quite fantastic. Firstly, I like to caramelise some finely diced pancetta or home-cured bacon to release some vital fat and get an amazing flavour base before adding finely chopped onion to sweat down slowly and gently. I will sweat the onion for a good fifteen minutes before adding anything else, making sure they become soft and sweet. To add some extra flavour and a nice touch of colour, I cooked some carrot dice and some baby button mushrooms in a separate pan to be stirred into the risotto at the very end, along with a generous handful of chopped herbs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,,Salmon and Holandaise,"This is another classic combination: it’s also an enduring favourite of mine. I’m a confessed fanatic of hollandaise sauce so I think this recipe was bound to find it’s way up here sooner or later! I’ve told you already about my love of of the best to crisp up, it colours quite easily and also has a delicious layer of fat underneath which melts in your mouth alongside the crunchy skin. The sumptuous oily flesh is offset perfectly by the vinegary tang of the sauce. I like to sit the salmon fillet on a bed of spinach sauteed with a little garlic, it complements the other strong flavours in the dish, and adds a nice bit of colour too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,,Duck Rillettes,"I think it’s high time I put a recipe for duck up here. This bird is rich in taste, tender in texture and a deep red colour; winning attributes I’m sure you’ll agree. At work we have made duck confit, pan fried breast (cooked pink and moist), terrine and rillettes. I also made some duck ham at home which was delicious. Duck’s versatility speaks for itself; there are a myriad different ways to prepare it. The best thing about it though is the thick layer of insulating fat under it’s skin which keeps the animal warm in freezing cold weather. For chefs this is the most indispensable part of the animal; the fat melts during cooking, keeping the meat beautifully moist and succulent. Excess fat collects in the bottom of the roasting tray but should never be thrown away! This is essential for your confit. This method of cooking meat was originally used for preservation, a form of charcuterie. Meat that had been lightly cured, then slowly and gently cooked in it’s own fat was then left to cool, the fat setting around the meat, completely sealing it from any moisture or bacteria from the air. When left for 5-6 months in a cool larder, the flavours had matured, resulting in a true authentic confit. It is not essential to mature your confit for quite this long; a fantastic flavour is still achievable in a few days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,,Raspberry Cordial,"I had some leftover raspberry puree from when I made the chocolate and raspberry brownies, so I decided to turn it into cordial. My mum makes blackcurrant cordial from hoards of blackcurrant bushes we have back home and it’s fantastic. She puts it in empty Ribena bottles and it’s indistinguishable from the genuine article! I’ve always loved Ribena, and although blackcurrant cordial is quite readily available I’ve never come across a raspberry version. So here it is; the sweet taste of summer in a bottle. A basic fruit cordial consists of fruit, sugar and water. My first attempt was simply to make a sugar syrup, add the raspberry puree and bring to the boil. The result was excellent, yielding a really fresh raspberry flavour. When I subsequently did some research online, I found that most of the recipes for fruit cordial involved heating the sugar water and fruit together and simmering for 10 minutes or so before allowing to cool and bottling. I tried a second batch using this method, also adding some lemon juice and peel for a extra dimension in flavour, and although the flavour was good it was not as fresh as the first method which didn’t involve cooking the fruit for as long. In addition I think it tasted better without the lemon; I believe the amazing flavour of fresh raspberries should be allowed to shine without hindrance. This is simple, unadorned raspberry flavour!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,,Braised Pig's Cheeks,"Pigs and pork has been a popular topic of conversation at work the past week or so, in part due to my adventures making bacon, and the amazing Ibérico ham which Marc and I sampled at a wine-tasting the other week. It’s easily the best ham I’ve ever tasted; it comes as a whole leg with hoof still attached, and a special wooden stand is provided to mount it on, enabling easy slicing. The black Iberian pigs that are reared for this ham are fed on a strict diet of acorns which gives the meat it’s distinctive flavour. The hams are salted and left for two weeks; they’re then rinsed and left to cure for 24-36 months. The result is a cured meat with brilliant texture and flavour. So, it was a happy moment when we found out we could get black Iberian pig’s cheeks from one of our meat suppliers at work. Marcus had told us of the delicious meal he cooked with pig’s cheeks he bought from Waitrose; they are tasty and very cheap. We ordered in a couple of packs of the special Iberian cheeks. This wasn’t to serve in the restaurant though, this was just for the boys to take home! So… I had six pigs cheeks in my fridge waiting to be turned into something tasty. As I was at work for the rest of the week it was going to be 4 days before I’d get time to cook them so I decided to brine the cheeks to prevent them from going off. I immersed them in brine for 24 hours, then in fresh water overnight to reduce the saltiness. I added garlic, peppercorns and bay to my brine to add some flavour. Then I got out of bed early this morning to get them in the oven. I got the idea of cooking pork with ale from a recipe for belly pork on the channel 4 website (here). I have done that recipe a few times now and it’s really, really tasty. So this pig’s cheeks recipe is pretty similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,,Pancakes,"Pancakes are great. When I was little I always looked forward to Shrove Tuesday because it was pancake day! Dinner consisted of as many pancakes as you could possibly eat, accompanied by a variety of fillings. The most popular, and an all-time classic was sugar and lemon juice. Simple and delicious; hard to beat. Other household favourites were bolognese sauce; maple syrup; and – I think it deserves a mention, although I realise that this will cause severe discontent among some – Marmite. “Crazy talk!” I hear you say, but if you (like me) are not a hater but a lover, put some Marmite on your pancake along with some butter, it’s fantastic. The final addition to my list of classic and favourite fillings is a relatively new one for me. My friend Richard, a fellow pancake obsessive, is an advocate for butter and sugar being the all-time best pancake filler. I was surprised that I had never before thought of this combination, they are two ingredients that almost everyone is bound to have in their house, and it’s a winner. So if you make pancakes you must try it. Make sure you use plenty of butter; fry the pancake in butter and put more butter on after flipping and before adding plenty of granulated sugar. Sweet buttery goodness. Lovely.Today I decided to have a break from tradition and try some new fillings. I found in my fridge some smoked salmon, crème fraîche and spinach… I waved my magic wand and very soon I had two delicious pancake fillings ready to be married in tasty happiness to some beautiful crêpes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,,Steak Tartare,"I have become very fond of raw meat. I only recently tried steak tartare, the classic dish of diced raw beef, for the first time and instantly fell in love with it. It is traditionally served with finely chopped shallots, parsley, capers and gherkins, and I have learned that there is some debate about how many extra ingredients to add to the meat. Some like to include condiments such as Worcester sauce, tomato ketchup, mustard, lemon juice and even brandy. One thing is pretty indisputable though, which is that the meat – being the central aspect of the dish – should be of the highest possible quality. I have had discussions about steak tartare with Alan, fellow Wedgwood chef, who believes that this dish is a pure and simple celebration of meat and should be accompanied by little more than some herbs and seasoning. I appreciate his sentiment and agree that the dish should simple, but I do like to include a couple of extra ingredients…",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,,Lamb Bolognese,"Bolognese sauce in our household was always quite different to what most would consider classic bolognese, which would typically be made with beef and pork. Our sauce would nearly always contain some lamb due to the abundant supply in our freezer. The mince from our own lamb was usually quite fatty and, when mixed in equal parts with lean beef mince, gave a lovely depth of flavour and body to the sauce. It always tasted fantastic; ladled onto a mountain of spaghetti with handfuls of grated parmesan I would devour it with gusto. Lamb bolognese is almost unheard of, which is a shame because it’s so delicious! In my view this is tastier than the classic beef bolognese and I bet that many would agree. Saying that, the recipe I’ve made here is not a plain spag-bol but a modified version, or upgraded, I should say. I made it a little bit creamier than usual, and added extra garlic. A good pile of baby spinach is thrown in and wilted down to tangle with the spaghetti as everything is mixed together. Parmesan cheese is mixed in, along with a splash of the salted starchy pasta water and finally some cherry tomatoes at the very last just to warm through gently. The final sauce is really rich and creamy, with the spinach and tomatoes giving a juiciness that stands up to the strong flavoured lamb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,,"Poached egg, Sauteed Potatoes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,,Pollack a la Grenobloise,"A stalwart from the classic French repertoire, à la grenobloise has got to be one of my favourite accompaniments to fish. Raymond Blanc in his excellent Kitchen Secrets, does pollack fillet à la grenobloise with pomme purée, “a dish which is cooked in homes all over France”. The classic consists of beurre noisette, capers, lemon and parsley, but I like to add some tomato concasse like we did at The Honours for a scallop dish, it adds an extra sweet juiciness and a nice bit of colour. Pollack is great, and really underrated in my opinion; from the same family as cod, it has a more chunky texture which I love. You could also use coley or hake as a happy substitute. This dish is best served with smooth buttery pomme purée I reckon, as Raymond Blanc’s recipe, but some boiled new potatoes would be just fine also. Pan-fried fish is such a pleasure for me. The skin is the best bit; fried until golden and crisp, contrasting with perfectly cooked moist flesh underneath. Delicious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,,Chocolate and Raspberry Brownies,"It’s been too long since I posted anything on here, I have been a bit preoccupied lately with finding a new home. Now settled in and enjoying the comforts of a nice flat with a better equipped kitchen than the last one (the kitchen is, after all, the most important room in any house) I am set to get blogging again. I’m very aware that there’s a lack of sweet things on this blog. I must make amends. Also, I had an idea to do a series of recipes involving quintessential Scottish ingredients…such as raspberries! This is a replication of the brownies that Marc made at Wedgwood last week; I used Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall’s basic brownie recipe as a basis. For chocoholics this is a truly indulgent affair, and combined with a gorge of fresh summer fruit in the form of juicy raspberries it’s brilliant. A fantastic marriage of flavours. The brownie should be shiny and cracked on top, hiding the heavenly soft centre which any brownie lover craves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,,Asian Noodle Soup,"When we were in Vietnam we fell in love with pho, the “noodle soup that build a nation”; eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner and sold in hundreds of make-shift street stalls on virtually every corner in Hanoi, the nation’s bustling capital. We would perch on tiny plastic stools with soup and chopsticks in hand, slurping down the powerful broth while millions of motorbikes provided a symphony of background humming. The most common – and best – was pho bo, rich dark beef stock laden with strips of tender meat and tendons of beef, fragrant spices and light noodles. There was always a basket of bright leaves served alongside, herb-like greens which, when torn in rustic pieces into the bowl gave the perfect balance of freshness to the meaty soup. This is my own, slightly simpler version of noodle broth. Although it doesn’t compare to proper Vietnamese pho it’s a reasonable substitute! To make this recipe you will need to invest some time in making proper beef stock. This takes at least eight hours of gentle simmering and I urge you to do this; the resulting flavour will be far superior than any shop-bought alternative. I haven’t added any actual meat to the soup as I reckoned there is enough flavour from the stock alone, but feel free to add some strips of cooked beef if you wish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,,Apple Tarte Tatin,"When I was younger I always preferred savoury food over sweet, but since working in restaurants and learning to make proper desserts I have come to have a greater appreciation for them. In expanding my culinary repertoire I will embrace all types of food equally, both sweet and savoury! Tarte Tatin is a dessert that we used to do for lunch at Wedgwood; it’s a classic French dish, delicious and quite easy to make. As with a lot of food I love, I really appreciate the simplicity of it. The combination of rich sweet caramel and tart apples is balanced beautifully by the smoothness from the butter; these are flavours that were made for each other. It’s the prime season for apples right now so this is a good time to make it! I’ve never tried making puff pastry from scratch before, as I know it’s a time consuming process, but I’d like to do it some time. I’ll put a recipe up on here when I do, but for now I’m just using ready-rolled pastry from the shop which is of pretty good quality anyway and saves a lot of time. Just four ingredients make up this amazing dessert: apples, sugar, butter and puff pastry. As for the apples, a tart eating variety is needed – I recommend Cox as the best option as they have a great flavour and also hold their shape well when cooked instead of turning mushy. Since it’s such a simple dish, the quality of each individual ingredient is more important so I would suggest getting a block of some really nice expensive butter for this. Desserts are a luxury anyway so you might as well do it properly!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,,Ricotta,"As a lover of cheese, the idea of making my own was obviously an appeal. My friend Guy gave me a book called Making Your Own Cheese and it has recipes for most common cheeses. The simplest involves very little process; take some milk and split it into its separate components by adding something acidic. The solid stuff, curds, are then drained off from the liquid. Once fully drained the curds are seasoned with salt. That’s it! This is the beautiful simplicity of ricotta; all other cheeses involve some process from this stage to arrive at the final product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,,Red Onion Chutney,"Preserving and pickling is something that I have a great appreciation for. The beauty of preserving food is that fresh fruit and veg which is in season and plentiful can be enjoyed throughout the year when it is no longer available. Nowadays in supermarkets one can buy almost any vegetable at any time of year as food is imported from all over the world, but if you care about using seasonal and local produce – as I do – then you will also see the huge benefit in preserving. Rene Redzepi, head chef at Noma in Copenhagen, is the master of using seasonal and local produce. In summer is all the more crucial.I had a recipe for this amazing red onion chutney which I thought I’d lost. The last time I made it I couldn’t find the recipe so had to improvise and, although tasty, it wasn’t as good as the original. The old recipe was an adaptation of the red onion chutney that we used to make at Blackmore’s. I changed the spices and added white wine for extra flavour. It has a fantastic rich sweetness that is hard not to adore. This chutney, as with many pickles, improves and matures with age. Ideally it should be left in the jar for at least six months before eating. It will taste great if eaten immediately of course, but I recommend waiting! Serve this chutney with cheese and crackers, or put in a cheese and ham sandwich for an extra punch of flavour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,,Porridge Oats and Banana Cake,"This is a really tasty recipe I found online a few weeks ago, and it's perfect for breakfast or brunch. Two of breakfast's long-time favourites, banana and oats, come together here to make a sort of flapjack. Because of the addition of milk and eggs, the texture is more like that of a coarse, oaty cake rather than a flapjack, which I thought was very good. Serve a generous wedge of it with your coffee in the morning for a breakfast of champions!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,,Pumpkin and Parmesan Soup,"It’s been too long since I made soup. Back home on the farm in the winter I used to make soup for lunch almost every day; a big pot of warming goodness accompanied by dad’s homemade bread with lovely salty butter smeared on it. For me this was the perfect antidote to a winter’s day, coming in from the cold to feel my body warming from the inside out as I eagerly spooned it down! Mum made the best soups; her two staples were leek and potato, and a chunky tomato soup with carrots and celery added, and white rice to thicken it, a sort of version of minestrone. It’s fantastic, I’ll post the recipe up here sometime. This soup is best in autumn when pumpkins are in season, otherwise winter squash is a good alternative. The sweetness of the pumpkin needs something strong and savoury to balance it, which is where the parmesan comes in. The combination is beautiful. Good home-made chicken stock adds to the savoury notes, and I added cream for richness. Garnishing finally with some chives which gives a hint of acidity as well as a pleasing touch of green. Also, leafing through Marcus Wareing again, I got the idea of browning the butter before adding the pumpkin, giving a really nice nutty flavour.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,,Leek and Potato Soup,"One of my mum’s reliable lunchtime soups in the winter is leek and potato; two ingredients that are always in good supply from her veg garden at this time. More of a rustic broth than a soup, with satisfying chunks of leek and roughly diced potato brought together with delicious meat stock, usually the result of lamb or beef bones left over from a roast. Any jelly or roasting juices left from this would be thrown in too, adding to the savouriness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,,Chicken with butter and Herbs,"As all food lovers will agree, it is a heinous crime to not make stock with the carcass left after your roast chicken dinner. The thing that frustrates me is that this delicious stock can’t be used for the same meal, it must be saved for another time. I wanted to be able to use all of the chicken, bones and all, in the same way I did with my the meat off the bone. The wings and the remaining carcass were used to make a delicious stock which I reduced down to make a rich intense sauce. The succulent juicy leg meat was gently reheated with a few spoonfuls of sauce and a generous knob of butter to give a nice glaze. Generous handfuls of chopped fresh herbs, mixed in just enough to barely wilt, were added at the very end. The herbs provide a refreshing aspect to counter the strong flavoured sauce. As far as the garnish goes, mushrooms and leeks are excellent partners to chicken and the leeks add a nice bit of colour to the dish. You can use any vegetable you wish however.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,,Chicken Caesar Salad,"Jack, John and myself often used to make this in our flat in Sheffield. It’s easy to rustle up pretty quickly, and if you make your own authentic caesar dressing as we did, it’s proper and delicious too. The dressing is key to this dish; it’s a super-enriched mayonnaise, packed with powerful savoriness from garlic, parmesan, anchovies and olive oil. The richness is balanced by a vital squeeze of lemon juice. We always used chicken breast, gently baked in the oven until just cooked, but I’ve switched to using leg now as the darker flaky meat has more flavour and a more pleasing rustic feel that is nicely suited to this dish. This salad should provide a fantastic interplay of textures. It balances juicy shredded chicken with crunchy fresh leaves of lettuce and crisp bacon, all bound happily together by the glossy rich dressing. Extra crunch is given by lovely golden croutons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,,Chicken and Smoked Ham Pie,"Winter is coming and the time for hearty and warming stews topped with delicious golden crisp pastry is near. Pies! My mouth is watering at just the thought. I already wrote about pies when I did a series of posts on classic home cooking, namely my delicious steak pie and shepherd’s pie but I really felt that chicken pie needed to be added to the collection since this tasty meat is so loved by the masses, including myself! I was truly thrifty with this dish, wasting nothing, as one always should when eating meat. Here I took one small bird and got maximum use from it, roasting the meat on the bone then using the carcass to make some stock. I then reduced this down to intensify the flavour and enriched it with sherry and a little beurre manié to make the gravy for the pie. This dish will take most of the day to cook, but I make no apologies for this; I hate to compromise flavour for the sake of saving time. Anyway, there are few things that I enjoy more than spending all afternoon in the kitchen creating something delicious. I served it with some leeks sauteed in butter, it was fantastic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,,Broccoli and Stilton Soup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

61,,Tomato Concasse and Prawn Spaghetti,"I got the idea for this recipe when I was in India with Jack and Claire. We were in Goa and, growing tired of curry, were craving some western food for our dinner. We came upon an Italian restaurant on the edge of the beach, with plastic tables and chairs arranged under palm trees. Reputedly the pizzas and pasta were particularly good so we thought we’d give it a go. I went for ‘tomato and prawn spaghetti’ and it was absolutely delicious. It was a simple dish, using fresh tomatoes and little baby prawns. It had a really nice light sauce and was the perfect thing to eat on a hot evening, accompanied by a chilled bottle of beer! So this is my attempt at replicating that dish. It’s basically a sauce made from tomato juice, white wine and garlic, then thickened and enriched with butter. The diced tomato flesh and prawns are then simply added to heat through, just before serving. I used frozen cooked baby prawns, but if you can find fresh ones then all the better. It’s seasonal too; tomatoes are just about still good at this time of year, so make the most of it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
62,,Teal with Orange Sauce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,,Spaghetti Bolognese,"This has long been a staple dish in my repertoire and I think that I, like many of us, have a weakness for a good meaty pasta sauce. However, bolognese sauce can often turn out mediocre if thrown together in a hurry and without much thought. My philosophy for making a good bolognese rests on two principles. One: it should be really meaty, and two: it should simmer gently for a long time to tenderise the meat. My usual bolognese contains beef mince, pork mince, bacon, and pork sausage meat. This gives a nice combination of meaty flavours. It’s nice to vary things though, and I sometimes combine the beef mince with lamb or venison mince. Another thing about my bolognese, which is slightly controversial, is that I omit tomatoes and only include tomato puree. The main liquid component of the sauce instead comes from beef or pork stock, which promotes a richer meat flavour. This is an easy reliable meal, and a great one to serve if you have guests since just about everyone likes spaghetti bolognese! I usually make a big quantity, then freeze most of it before adding the cream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,,Slow Cooked Lamb,"I often think that I’m very lucky to have grown up on a sheep farm, as I have a reliable supply of delicious organic lamb to create tasty delights with on a regular basis. I received a delivery of half a lamb a few weeks ago to replenish my supply. All of a sudden the drawers of the freezer were happily jammed and stuffed with shoulder, leg, neck, a heart and countless chops. I wasn’t likely to go hungry any time soon! If I was forced to choose I would probably have to pick lamb as my favourite meat, which may seem surprising given that throughout my childhood I was nurtured and brought up on it! Far from being sick of it though, I think I have a greater appreciation of good quality meat from well raised animals. The county of Northumberland (that’s my home!) produces more lamb than any in Britain, and some of the most delicious lamb and mutton in the world is from there. I hate to see lamb from New Zealand on the supermarket shelves when we have much better tasting stuff right here on our doorstep! The tastiest I’ve ever had was from the farm back home, and I reckon this meat is the best to be found anywhere.This is from Raymond Blanc’s Kitchen Secrets, another reliable recipe which his mother, the legendary “Maman Blanc” would have made. Rustic home cooking. It’s lamb shoulder from my farm, slow-roasted to achieve a gorgeous melting texture, and with some bones and neck chops in the bottom of the pan along with wine and herbs creating an extremely flavoursome liquid to make the sauce with. For this I reduced the liquid slightly, thickened with some beurre manie and stirred in some finely chopped mint and a splash of white wine vinegar. Lamb and mint, another classic flavour combination. I served the lamb with some leek and carrot, finely sliced to mirror the flakiness of the meat, and some roasted new potatoes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,, Shoulder of Lamb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,,Shepherd's Pie,"Here’s another home-cooking classic to add to the collection. It seems pretty appropriate that shepherd’s pie was a staple dish for us, at home on a sheep farm in rural Northumberland. I think this dish was traditionally made with left over meat from a roast dinner, but my Mum usually made it with our own lamb or mutton mince, which was a bit fattier than shop-bought mince and stronger in flavour; it was always really rich and filling. I’ve adapted the recipe here; instead of mince I’m using neck and slowly braising it on the bone. It’s a method of cooking that I love; embrace the tougher, more flavoursome cuts of meat I say. Lamb neck is probably the tastiest part of the animal in my view, and very underrated. In the kitchen at work, we use veal stock as a base for most of our sauces; for something like this shepherd’s pie for example, we would make a rich jus from reduced veal stock to mix with the filling instead of gravy. The veal bones are slowly simmered in water for 2-3 days in order to extract maximum flavour and body from them. The gelatine extracted from the bones thickens the stock when it is reduced, so you get a naturally thick, rich jus without using flour. This is impractical to do at home, but you can get some way towards a proper jus when making a dish like this by cooking the meat on the bone, or adding bones to the braising liquid like I did with mysteak pie and pork belly. After reducing, the resulting sauce will be richer and have more body to it than if you hadn’t used bones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,,Seared Beef and Blue Cheese Salad,"I am celebrating Scottish produce and classic Scottish ingredients. Raspberries were first in the spotlight as I was intent on getting some sweet things on this blog, and also because they are so quintessentially Scottish. One of the other things that first sprung to mind when I tried thinking of ingredients was beef. Aberdeen Angus beef is widely regarded as the finest in the world and it is native to the counties of Aberdeenshire and Angus in Scotland. A nicely cooked steak from a well aged tender piece of Scottish beef is truly a thing of joy; definitely something worth celebrating! Since it is summer, even though typically it is actually cold and raining outside, I decided not to do steak but a salad. This one is warm and savoury, with delicious rare nuggets of seared beef being the focal point. Another component of this mouth watering concoction is blue cheese; Dunsyre Blue, another example of excellent Scottish produce, is from Lanarkshire, a county renowned for it’s cheeses. You know already of my fondness for been hung for at least 21 days. Which cut to use? Fillet is coveted for being extremely tender and succulent, which is exactly what I am looking for here, so that is what I shall use. Ask for fillet trim or the tail end as it will be cheaper. To complete the dish I have used baby spinach and tomatoes, giving the dish a striking colour contrast, with croutons to add texture variation. The tomatoes also bring a vital acidity in flavour that cuts beautifully through the rich meat and blue cheese.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,,Salmon Tartare,"I haven’t got one single post about fish on this blog yet, which is a shame because I’ve been living in Edinburgh for a while now and, being in Scotland and situated right next to the sea, it’s obviously a great place for eating seafood. I admit that I’m a bit of a novice when it comes to fish as I don’t often cook it, although I do love eating it. I recently invested in a copy of the River Cottage Fish Book which has provided a good bit of inspiration. Flicking through it the other day, a photo of salmon tartare grabbed my attention. Since making steak tartare recently and appreciating it’s beautiful simplicity, salmon tartare obviously appealed to me. Steak tartare is a celebration of well-aged, tender beef that is full of flavour. Salmon tartare is much the same: the piece of fish used must be top quality and as fresh as possible. Finding such a piece of fish was not going to be a problem in Edinburgh, and was particularly easy for me asArmstrong’s fishmongers, recognized by many as the best in the city, happens to be just down the road from my flat. “All of this was fresh this morning” he assured me when I told him I needed a piece of salmon as fresh as possible. On slicing it was clearly very fresh, the orange-pink flesh glossy and firm. Tasting it as it was, pure and unadorned, it already had excellent flavour. Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall uses Tabasco and Worcester sauce in his recipe which I chose to omit here as I think the amazing flavour of the fish shouldn’t be masked too much by additives. My version of the dish, I believe, includes enough extra ingredients to compliment and enhance the natural flavour of the fish without overpowering it. One of my favourite things about this dish is the magic worked by the lemon juice. As well as imparting sharp fresh flavour, the acid in the lemon juice affects the protein in the fish, causing a “cooked” texture on the surface of the meat. The acid denatures the protein molecules just as heat does when cooking, and as the brine did in my pig’s cheeks recipe. Pickling things in vinegar, again, has the same denaturing effect. All of these in a sense are just different ways of cooking meat. The advantage of using a method like this is that the fresh flavour of the raw meat does not change nearly as much as if you cooked it. The salmon will continue to “cook” for as long as it is left to marinate in the lemon juice. I would recommend no more than 5 minutes; this will result in a fairly thin layer of cooked-texture meat surrounding a lovely soft rare centre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,,Roast Partridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,,Rabbit Liver Parfait,"Until recently I hated eating liver. One of our regular meals at home was a bacon and tomato pasta sauce which was finished with sautéed chicken livers. I would always baulk at the livers and have just the pasta sauce instead. The flavour has grown on me recently though and I actually love it now. Strange though I have always loved paté. Mum always made it at Christmas time, which we’d have on toast with chutney and salad for lunch; delicious! She made it by frying the liver with bacon, adding some herbs, a splash of sherry and some cream then puréeing and leaving to set in a bowl. It was a favourite and always got finished quickly. When I was working at Blackmore’s I got introduced to chicken liver parfait. It’s a luxurious version of pate that is enriched with eggs and butter. All the ingredients are blitzed together raw, poured into a mould and cooked very gently so that the finished article is still beautifully pink. It’s really fantastic, and easily the best way to treat livers in my opinion. You may have heard me talk before of a farmer’s dislike of rabbits. With the help of a rifle my brother acquired 18 wild rabbits from the farm at home, brought them up to Edinburgh and put them into his freezer. I went over to his house today and got a couple to make something tasty with. I also picked up all of the livers from the rabbits which he had set aside. Rabbit liver parfait! Rabbit liver has a similar consistency to chicken liver but tastes miles better. It would be perfect to make parfait with. I couldn’t find any recipes for rabbit parfait so I have used Raymond Blanc’s recipe for chicken liver parfait and adapted it slightly. I cooked it in a water bath in a cool oven to ensure that the heat transfer is gentle and we end up with a lovely pink colour. To execute this recipe properly, you will need a temperature probe, otherwise determining when the parfait is done is pretty much guess work. Because liver parfait is so rich, it needs to be garnished appropriately. Pickle or chutney is great as it has an acidic kick of vinegar which cuts through the meaty savouriness. Add some salad leaves for freshness and you have an excellent dish. Served on toast, or with delicate melba toast as I did, and you have a luxurious and delicious platter for your lunch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

72,,Peanut Butter Caramel Shortbread,"My mum makes excellent millionaire shortbread. It’s a treat when she comes to visit because I always get a tin full of lovely caramel-y chocolatey shortbread squares. On a daily basis I’ll come home from work and, hungry, peruse the fridge for something to eat. The tin of shortbread generally gets raided whilst I’m deciding what to make for my dinner…just one piece usually ends up being two or three; needless to say the millionaire shortbread supply never lasts long! I had the idea of doing peanut butter caramel because my girlfriend Mairi loves peanut butter. Although I do like peanut butter, it’s nowhere near as much as Mairi. She adores it, eats it every day on bagels for breakfast. So this was a good excuse to treat her. Since peanut butter and chocolate is already established as a good flavour combination it was just a small logical step to make peanut butter millionaire shortbread. I’ve been doing blog posts on Scottish ingredients and recipes, and shortbread is definitely a Scottish thing so I suppose at a stretch this is a Scottish recipe! On flicking through my recipe books, I picked up some tips on how to make shortbread. It’s such a simple thing to make, but it’s important to make it carefully so as not to end up with a poor result. When mixing the ingredients it’s vital to not overwork as the butter will begin to melt; then when it cooks it’ll be hard instead of the soft, melt-in-the-mouth consistency you’re looking for. Marcus Wareing suggests finely grating the chilled butter, then you hardly have to work the mixture with your hands and the butter barely softens at all. The result is excellent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,,Peanut Butter and Jam Creme Brulee,"One of the desserts we serve at Wedgwood is a marmalade on toast creme brulee; it has a layer of marmalade in the bottom of the ramekin and then a toast-infused cream that is set on top. It tastes fantastic. Since I was in ‘peanut butter mode’ after making my shortbread, I thought that the same method could work well with peanut butter and jam. This is basically a peanut flavoured custard set into a ramekin on top of some jam. To ‘brulee’ a normal creme brulee, sugar is sprinkled on top and then caramelised with a blow torch or by grilling. Tony, one of the Wedgwood chefs, suggested sprinkling on some toasted crushed peanuts at the end to create extra crunch, which I thought was a great idea. Nice one Tony! I decided to use salted peanuts, as the peanut butter contains salt anyway and it gives a nice contrast to the sweet cream and jam.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,,Risotto of Chanterelles,"I went back home to the farm this weekend for a bit of a gathering with the folks. Lots of food and wine and merriment was had. It also just happened to be the perfect season for my favourite mushrooms: chanterelles! There is a particular spot in the woods, beneath the silver birch trees, where I know I can find them. So we went up to see what we could find, and were not disappointed. There is a deep satisfaction in strolling through the woods foraging for mushrooms, knowing that they’re going to be turned into something really delicious back in the kitchen. Chanterelles are amazing things. Such an outrageous bright yellow colour, and with their trumpet-shaped curves they seem almost other-worldly. Surely the most photogenic of mushrooms. It seems about time I put a risotto recipe up here. You may have noticed that I have a thing for Italian food; I love the ethos behind it: simple and delicious. Risotto was introduced to me a few years ago by my good friend Cecily, and I instantly fell in love with it. I love the mechanics; the constant meticulous stirring, coaxing the starch out of the rice. Since then I have made many many risottos. So here it is on the blog at last. The key to an excellent risotto, I believe, is to have a good stock. So if possible make it from scratch rather than using a stock cube. If you make a roast chicken for dinner, you can use the carcass to make stock and have a fantastic risotto for dinner the next day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

76,,Macaroni Cheese,"Macaroni cheese is a classic home-made dish for me. It was a firm favourite for us three at home especially for Rob who would devour mountains of it with lashings of tomato ketchup. We were so particular about the consistency of the sauce, being adamant that it had to be “nice and sloppy”. These days I like it a little thicker but still loose enough to be gooey and tempting, and with a nice golden gratin to give contrast in texture. One thing my parents did was to put slices of tomato on the top among the cheese. As a big fan of tomatoes, I would highly advise this. It gives a light freshness to balance the weight of all that cheese. The quality of a macaroni can be judged by the quality of it’s cheese sauce. My Dad taught me how to make perfectly smooth cheese sauce (or white sauce); he told me to add the milk to the roux in stages, and stir thoroughly each time to ensure that its totally smooth before adding more. It’s completely fail-safe and I’ve never made a lumpy cheese sauce since. Thanks Dad!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

78,,Granny's Spelt Bread,"I went to visit my granny last week. She lives on a farm on the west coast of Scotland near Oban, right by the sea where it’s windswept and wild. The best bit about going to visit my granny is that you get treated with her home-made bread. She makes beautiful wholegrain rolls with seeds in and treacle to make them extra dark, rich and malty. They’re the tastiest, nourishing things you could imagine. She used to make them with normal wheat flour, but in recent years she found that she has an intolerance to wheat gluten so she uses spelt flour now instead. Spelt is brilliant. It’s an ancestor of wheat that has been used for around 9000 years. There are various references to it in the Old Testament and spelt bread was a favourite of the Romans. It was an important crop in the development of civilisation because it thrived in poor growing conditions and was particularly resistant to disease and pests due the tough outer husk surrounding the grain. Spelt has become redundant as a crop in modern times as preference has moved to higher-yield varieties of wheat that are better suited to the commercial bread industry. Recently though, spelt has been rediscovered and you can buy it from some health food shops and delicatessens. As well as making bread with the flour you can make excellent risotto from whole spelt grains, as they do in a number of restaurants now. My granny doesn’t knead the dough at all, which gives a pleasing rustic consistency to the bread. She also uses fairly hot water to activate the yeast; the water shouldn’t be too hot, as this would kill the yeast, but just hand-hot (about 50C). This relatively high temperature causes the bread to rise quickly, resulting in lots of little air pockets. Her technique for baking the bread is to simply bake all of the dough into one large flat loaf, then cut it up into roll-sized portions once it has cooled. If you prefer, you could shape into individual rolls and bake them separately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

80,,Dry-cured Bacon,"Since my last batch of dry cure bacon had been finished up a while ago, it was high time I made some more. Although I was pleased with the last lot, I was slightly annoyed by the fact I had to soak it in water to reduce the saltiness, as the flavour from the rosemary, sugar and black peppercorns will have also been reduced. Whilst browsing the River Cottage forums one day, I read about other people who had had the same problem when following Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall’s recipe for dry cure bacon. There was one person, Howard, who had done alot of research and looked at several different recipes before he tried curing his bacon, and said it turned out beautifully. So I decided to follow his guidelines. Thanks to Howard for the useful info! Here’s a link. I love making bacon. Such a simple procedure, with such amazing results. It’s quite comforting to have a load of delicious streaky bacon sitting in my fridge, waiting to be turned into something tasty. Again, I got a hold of a whole pork belly (I don’t like to do things by half), but it wasn’t all for me; the other chefs Marc, Marcus and Alan from work were going to split the cost with me for a piece of bacony loveliness. I was more adventurous with the flavourings this time; nutmeg and rosemary were the primary notes, with undertones from a few other spices also coming through. I did actually end up soaking the bacon, but only for 1 hour this time, so the extra flavours were still noticeable in the finished bacon. I didn’t manage to get a hold of any salt petre unfortunately, so the bacon won’t keep its pinkness when cooked. The flavour will unaffected though, which is the main thing. I’m very happy with the end product; I have delicious things in store for it. It was a source of comfort and joy to have my bacon hanging up in the kitchen, slowly maturing and increasing in firmness and flavour. Everyone should try making bacon, it’s so easy, and you will have a product which is many miles better than anything you can get in a supermarket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

84,,"Pork Belly, Asparagus and Ale Sauce","The belly has long been my favourite part of the pig. There are two things I generally prefer to do with a pork belly; either salt it and cure it to make dry-cured bacon, or braise it long and slow, for about 12 hours, then press and chill it before roasting it until crispy. Pork belly cooked this way has the most amazing mouthfeel; the meat itself is succulent and has fat running through the layers that melts in your mouth, and the skin that sits atop is the most fantastic crisp pork crackling. It’s a great contrast of textures!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
